<p>The Mahout Collections library is a set of container classes that address
some limitations of the standard collections in Java. <a href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/sevitsky.pubs.html/$FILE/oopsla08%20memory-efficient%20java%20slides.pdf">This presentation</a>
 describes a number of performance problems with the standard collections.</p>

<p>Mahout collections addresses two of the more glaring: the lack of support
for primitive types and the lack of open hashing.</p>

<h2 id="primitive-types">Primitive Types</h2>

<p>The most visible feature of Mahout Collections is the large collection of
primitive type collections. Given Javaâ€™s asymmetrical support for the
primitive types, the only efficient way to handle them is with many
classes. So, there are ArrayList-like containers for all of the primitive
types, and hash maps for all the useful combinations of primitive type and
object keys and values.</p>

<p>These classes do not, in general, implement interfaces from <em>java.util</em>.
Even when the <em>java.util</em> interfaces could be type-compatible, they tend
to include requirements that are not consistent with efficient use of
primitive types.</p>

<p><a name="mahout-collections-OpenAddressing"></a></p>
<h1 id="open-addressing">Open Addressing</h1>

<p>All of the sets and maps in Mahout Collections are open-addressed hash
tables. Open addressing has a much smaller memory footprint than chaining.
Since the purpose of these collections is to avoid the memory cost of
autoboxing, open addressing is a consistent design choice.</p>

<p><a name="mahout-collections-Sets"></a></p>
<h2 id="sets">Sets</h2>

<p>Mahout Collections includes open hash sets. Unlike <em>java.util</em>, a set is
not a recycled hash table; the sets are separately implemented and do not
have any additional storage usage for unused keys.</p>
