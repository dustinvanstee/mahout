<p>Neural Networks are a means for classifying multi dimensional objects. We
concentrate on implementing back propagation networks with one hidden layer
as these networks have been covered by the <a href="http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/ang/papers/nips06-mapreducemulticore.pdf">2006 NIPS map reduce paper</a>
. Those networks are capable of learning not only linear separating hyper
planes but arbitrary decision boundaries.</p>
