<h3 id="boltzmann-machines">Boltzmann Machines</h3>
<p>Boltzmann Machines are a type of stochastic neural networks that closely
resemble physical processes. They define a network of units with an overall
energy that is evolved over a period of time, until it reaches thermal
equilibrium.</p>

<p>However, the convergence speed of Boltzmann machines that have
unconstrained connectivity is low.</p>

<h3 id="restricted-boltzmann-machines">Restricted Boltzmann Machines</h3>
<p>Restricted Boltzmann Machines are a variant, that are ‘restricted’ in the
sense that connections between hidden units of a single layer are <em>not</em>
allowed. In addition, stacking multiple RBM’s is also feasible, with the
activities of the hidden units forming the base for a higher-level RBM. The
combination of these two features renders RBM’s highly usable for
parallelization.</p>

<p>In the Netflix Prize, RBM’s offered distinctly orthogonal predictions to
SVD and k-NN approaches, and contributed immensely to the final solution.</p>

<h3 id="rbms-in-apache-mahout">RBM’s in Apache Mahout</h3>
<p>An implementation of Restricted Boltzmann Machines is being developed for
Apache Mahout as a Google Summer of Code 2010 project. A recommender
interface will also be provided. The key aims of the implementation are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Accurate - should replicate known results, including those of the Netflix
Prize</li>
  <li>Fast - The implementation uses Map-Reduce, hence, it should be fast</li>
  <li>Scale - Should scale to large datasets, with a design whose critical
parts don’t need a dependency between the amount of memory on your cluster
systems and the size of your dataset</li>
</ol>
